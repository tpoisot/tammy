abstract: "In a context of global changes, and amidst the perpetual modification of\
  \ community structure undergone by most natural ecosystems, it is more important\
  \ than ever to understand how species interactions vary through space and time.\
  \ The integration of biogeography and network theory will yield important results\
  \ and further our understanding of species interactions. It has, however, been hampered\
  \ so far by the difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks. Here,\
  \ we propose a general framework to study the dissimilarity of species interaction\
  \ networks over time, space or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative\
  \ and qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into interactions and\
  \ species turnover components, so that it is immediately comparable to common measures\
  \ of \u03B2-diversity. We emphasise that scaling up \u03B2-diversity of community\
  \ composition to the \u03B2-diversity of interactions requires only a small methodological\
  \ step, which we foresee will help empiricists adopt this method. We illustrate\
  \ the framework with a large dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight\
  \ other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a biogeographical\
  \ theory of species interactions."
