abstract: Ecological specialisation concerns all species and underlies many major
  ecological and evolutionary patterns. Yet its status as a unifying concept is not
  always appreciated because of its similarity to concepts of the niche, the many
  levels of biological phenomena to which it applies, and the complexity of the mechanisms
  influencing it. The evolution of specialisation requires the coupling of constraints
  on adaptive evolution with covariation of genotype and environmental performance.
  This covariation itself depends upon organismal properties such as dispersal behaviour
  and life history and complexity in the environment stemming from factors such as
  species interactions and spatio-temporal heterogeneity in resources. Here, we develop
  a view on specialisation that integrates across the range of biological phenomena
  with the goal of developing a more predictive conceptual framework that specifically
  accounts for the importance of biotic complexity and coevolutionary events.
