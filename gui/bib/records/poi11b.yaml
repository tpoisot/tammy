abstract: Antagonistic networks are known to be structured in the wild, but knowledge
  on how this structure may change as a response to environmental perturbations is
  scarce. We describe a natural bipartite network between bacteria and lytic bacteriophages,
  and investigate how it is affected by environmental productivity in the form of
  different resource levels for the bacteria. We report that low amounts of resource
  decrease phage generality and lead to less robust and less stable communities. We
  discuss how resource levels in nature may alter the structure of complex communities.
