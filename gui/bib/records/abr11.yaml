abstract: 'Plant-pollinator mutualistic networks are asymmetric in their interactions:
  specialist plants are pollinated by generalist animals, while generalist plants
  are pollinated by a broad range involving specialists and generalists. It has been
  suggested that this asymmetric -or disassortative- assemblage could play an important
  role in determining the observed equal susceptibility of specialist and generalist
  plants under habitat destruction. At the core of the analysis of the phenomenon
  lies the observation that specialist plants, otherwise candidates to extinction,
  could cope with the disruption thanks to their interaction with a few generalist
  pollinators. We present a theoretical framework that supports this thesis. We analyze
  a dynamical model of a system of mutualistic plants and pollinators, subject to
  the destruction of their habitat. We analyze and compare two families of interaction
  topologies, ranging from highly assortative to highly disassortative ones, as well
  as real pollination networks. We found that several features observed in natural
  systems are predicted by the mathematical model. First, there is a tendency to increase
  the asymmetry of the network as a result of the extinctions. Second, an entropy
  measure of the differential susceptibility to extinction of specialist and generalist
  species show that they tend to balance when the network is disassortative. Finally,
  the disappearance of links in the network, as a result of extinctions, shows that
  specialist plants preserve more connections than the corresponding plants in an
  assortative system, enabling them to resist the disruption.'
