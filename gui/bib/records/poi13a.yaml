abstract: Connectance and degree distributions are important components of the structure
  of ecological networks. In this contribution, we use a statistical argument and
  simple network generating models to show that properties of the degree distribution
  are driven by network connectance. We discuss the consequences of this finding for
  (1) the generation of random networks in null-model analyses, and (2) the interpretation
  of network structure and ecosystem properties in relationship with degree distribution.
