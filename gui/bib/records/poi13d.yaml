abstract: "The biodiversity\u2013ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationship is central\
  \ in community ecology. Its drivers in competitive systems (sampling effect and\
  \ functional complementarity) are intuitive and elegant, but we lack an integrative\
  \ understanding of these drivers in complex ecosystems. Because networks encompass\
  \ two key components of the BEF relationship (species richness and biomass flow),\
  \ they provide a key to identify these drivers, assuming that we have a meaningful\
  \ measure of functional complementarity. In a network, diversity can be defined\
  \ by species richness, the number of trophic levels, but perhaps more importantly,\
  \ the diversity of interactions. In this paper, we define the concept of trophic\
  \ complementarity (TC), which emerges through exploitative and apparent competition\
  \ processes, and study its contribution to ecosystem functioning. Using a model\
  \ of trophic community dynamics, we show that TC predicts various measures of ecosystem\
  \ functioning, and generate a range of testable predictions. We find that, in addition\
  \ to the number of species, the structure of their interactions needs to be accounted\
  \ for to predict ecosystem productivity."
