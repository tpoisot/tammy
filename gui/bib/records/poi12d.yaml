abstract: Understanding the mechanisms underlying ecological specialization is central
  to our understanding of community ecology and evolution. Although theoretical work
  has investigated how variable environments may affect specialization in single species,
  little is known about how such variation impacts bipartite network structure in
  antagonistically coevolving systems. Here, we develop and analyse a general model
  of victim-enemy coevolution that explicitly includes resource and population dynamics.
  We investigate how temporal environmental heterogeneity affects the evolution of
  specialization and associated community structure. Environmental productivity influences
  victim investment in resistance, which will shape patterns of specialization through
  its regulating effect on enemy investment in infectivity. We also investigate the
  epidemiological consequences of environmental variability and show that enemy population
  density is maximized for intermediate lengths of productive seasons, which corresponds
  to situations where enemies can evolve higher infectivity than victims can evolve
  defence. We discuss our results in the light of empirical studies, and further highlight
  ways in which our model applies to a range of natural systems.
