abstract: 'In the present study, we used morphometry as a proxy to study the microevolution
  of generalist Lamellodiscus (Monogenea, Diplectanidae) species, comprising gill
  parasites of sparid fish. We investigated 147 individuals, belonging to nine described
  species, regrouped in four morphotypes. Morphometric measurements were taken on
  sclerotized parts of the attachment organ. The formation of groups on the basis
  of the global morphometry within a host species, or between several host species,
  was assessed using both exploratory analyses (principal component analysis and clustering
  analysis) and statistical tests. We showed that: (1) for three out of four morphotypes,
  the global morphometry was significantly different according to host species used,
  and (2) the coexistence of two populations of Lamellodiscus elegans on Diplodus
  sargus could reflect an ongoing intra-host speciation event. We suggest that generalist
  Lamellodiscus are undergoing specialization on their different hosts, which may
  lead to speciation.'
