abstract: "Bacteriophages (phages) modify microbial communities by lysing hosts, transferring\
  \ genetic material, and effecting lysogenic conversion. To understand how natural\
  \ communities are affected it is important to develop predictive models. Here we\
  \ consider how variation between models\u2013in eclipse period, latent period, adsorption\
  \ constant, burst size, the handling of differences in host quantity and host quality,\
  \ and in modeling strategy\u2013can affect predictions. First we compare two published\
  \ models of phage growth, which differ primarily in terms of how they model the\
  \ kinetics of phage adsorption; one is a computer simulation and the other is an\
  \ explicit calculation. At higher host quantities (approximately 10(8) cells/ml),\
  \ both models closely predict experimentally determined phage population growth\
  \ rates. At lower host quantities (10(7) cells/ml), the computer simulation continues\
  \ to closely predict phage growth rates, but the explicit model does not. Next we\
  \ concentrate on predictions of latent-period optima. A latent-period optimum is\
  \ the latent period that maximizes the population growth of a specific phage growing\
  \ in the presence of a specific quantity and quality of host cells. Both models\
  \ predict similar latent-period optima at higher host densities (e.g., 17 min at\
  \ 10(8) cells/ml). At lower host densities, however, the computer simulation predicts\
  \ latent-period optima that are much shorter than those suggested by explicit calculations\
  \ (e.g., 90 versus 1,250 min at 10(5) cells/ml). Finally, we consider the impact\
  \ of host quality on phage latent-period evolution. By taking care to differentiate\
  \ latent-period phenotypic plasticity from latent-period evolution, we argue that\
  \ the impact of host quality on phage latent-period evolution may be relatively\
  \ small."
