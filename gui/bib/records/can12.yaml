abstract: "Interaction networks are central elements of ecological systems and have\
  \ very complex structures. Historically, much effort has focused on niche-mediated\
  \ processes to explain these structures, while an emerging consensus posits that\
  \ both niche and neutral mechanisms simultaneously shape many features of ecological\
  \ communities. However, the study of interaction networks still lacks a comprehensive\
  \ neutral theory. Here we present a neutral model of predator-prey interactions\
  \ and analyze the structural characteristics of the simulated networks. We find\
  \ that connectance values (complexity) and complexity-diversity relationships of\
  \ neutral networks are close to those observed in empirical bipartite networks.\
  \ High nestedness and low modularity values observed in neutral networks fall in\
  \ the range of those from empirical antagonist bipartite networks. Our results suggest\
  \ that, as an alternative to niche-mediated processes that induce incompatibility\
  \ between species (\u201Cniche forbidden links\u201D), neutral processes create\
  \ \u201Cneutral forbidden links\u201D due to uneven species abundance distributions\
  \ and the low probability of interaction between rare species. Neutral trophic networks\
  \ must be seen as the missing endpoint of a continuum from niche to purely stochastic\
  \ approaches of community organization."
