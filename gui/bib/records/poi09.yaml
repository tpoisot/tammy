abstract: Relationships between immunocompetence, somatic condition, parasitism and
  water temperature in a wild population of chub Leuciscus cephalus were investigated.
  The effects of a rapid temperature increase in early spring were studied for both
  sexes as water temperature affects immunocompetence. Investment in gonads and activity
  of mucus lysozyme were negatively correlated; lysozyme activity decreased as temperature
  increased. No correlations were found between lysozyme activity and parasitism or
  intensity of infection by monogeneans, the most abundant metazoan parasite group
  in L. cephalus. There was a positive correlation, however, between respiratory burst
  intensity and parasitism. Indices of investment in gonads and spleen were correlated,
  showing that energetic reserves allowed either investment in gonads and spleen,
  or that spleen investment, even if often used in other studies in immunoecology,
  was not always a significant indicator of immunocompetence during this period. This
  last proposition is supported by the lack of correlation between spleen investment
  and other factors linked to immunocompetence.
