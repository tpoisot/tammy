abstract: 'Functional and phylogenetic diversity are increasingly quantified in various
  fields of ecology and conservation biology. The need to maintain diversity turnover
  among sites, so-called beta-diversity, has also been raised in theoretical and applied
  ecology. In this study, we propose the first comprehensive framework for the large-scale
  mapping of taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity and of their respective
  turnover. Using high-resolution data on the spatial distribution and abundance of
  birds at a country scale, we disentangled areas of mismatches and congruencies between
  biodiversity compo- nents. We further revealed unequal representation of each component
  in protected areas: functional diversity was significantly under-represented whereas
  taxonomic diversity was significantly over-represented in protected areas. Our results
  challenge the use of any one diversity component as a surrogate for other components
  and stress the need to adopt an integrative approach to biodiversity conservation.'
