abstract: "Despite knowledge about microbial responses to abiotic stress, few studies\
  \ have investigated stress responses to antagonistic species, such as competitors,\
  \ predators and pathogens. While it is often assumed that interacting populations\
  \ of bacteria and phage will coevolve resistance and exploitation strategies, an\
  \ alternative is that individual bacteria tolerate or evade phage predation through\
  \ inducible responses to phage presence. Using the microbial model Pseudomonas fluorescens\
  \ SBW25 and its lytic DNA phage SBW25\u03A62, we demonstrate the existence of an\
  \ inducible response in the form of a transient increase in population growth rate,\
  \ and found that the response was induced by phage binding. This response was accompanied\
  \ by a decrease in bacterial cell size, which we propose to be an associated cost.\
  \ We discuss these results in the context of bacterial ecology and phage-bacteria\
  \ co-evolution."
